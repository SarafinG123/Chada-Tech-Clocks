# Chada-Tech-Clocks

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

    For this project I was asked to create a 12 hour and 24 hour clock that display simultaneously and allow for user input for Chada Tech. Chada Tech has international and domestic clients so having both clocks are ideal.


What did you do particularly well?

    I think I did well with creating the code to convert the 24 hour time to a 12 hour and I also think my variales are easy to read.


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

    I believe that in order to enhance my code I would have separated everything into differet classes. This would enhance the managability of the code.


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

    When working on this project, I initially struggled with converting the 24 hour time to the 12 hour time. I wasn't sure what would have been the best practices to use to accomplish it but with the help of Geeksforgeeks.org and the help of family who are in the tech space, I was able to accomplish it.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

    I belive that the readability and the in line comments are skills that I can apply to other projects.


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

    I made this program readable by making sure that i includee in line comments to show what the purpose of that part of the code is for.
